# Fifa_Player_Prediction

## ABSTRACT
The FIFA 18 Player Performance Prediction dataset is a comprehensive dataset containing various statistics related to football player performance in the FIFA 18 game. With the exponential increase in the size of the dataset, the traditional methods of analyzing data have become insufficient. The need for efficient and scalable big data technologies has increased tremendously in recent years, and Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark are some of the most widely used big data technologies for processing large volumes of data. In this abstract, we propose the use of these technologies for analyzing the FIFA 18 Player Performance Prediction dataset. We discuss the challenges associated with the dataset and demonstrate how big data technologies can be used to preprocess, analyze, and model the data. We also explore the potential applications of this dataset, such as player performance prediction, team building, and player scouting, which can greatly benefit from big data analytics. Finally, we discuss the importance of utilizing big data technologies for analyzing large datasets, and how it can lead to more accurate predictions and better decision-making in the sports industry. These abstract highlights the significance of big data technologies in analyzing the FIFA 18 Player Performance Prediction dataset, and how it can provide valuable insights into football player performance.
	
### INTRODUCTION
This dataset is a collection of data related to the performance of professional football players during the 2017-2018 season. The dataset includes information on players physical attributes, playing position, team, and individual statistics such as goals scored, assists, and successful passes. In this project, big data technologies will be used to analyze the dataset and develop predictive models to forecast player performance based on their attributes and past performances. The project aims to leverage the power of big data technologies such as PySpark to handle large volumes of data and perform efficient and scalable data processing, data analysis, and machine learning. 
The project will involve data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes etc. will be implemented to develop accurate and reliable prediction models. The results of the project can be used by football clubs, coaches, and fans to gain insights into player performance and make informed decisions regarding player selection and team strategy.



 ### DATA OPERATIONS AND PROCESS FOR ANALYSIS
 1. ETL pipeline: Extract data from the above-mentioned datasets and pass them through the ETL pipeline using steps to clean any anomalies in the text, setting all values in a number format, fixing all incorrect values and missing values.
Data Analytics: We performed different operations on the fields to get the required analysis. We studied the data and transformed the data into graphs. We studied the graphs and made an analysis of all the data.

 2. Create a Model: Once the data has been collected, transformed and the features has been designed , the next step is to create a Machine learning model using techniques like Random Forest, Logistic regression, Gradient Boosting etc. where this machine learning model is trained by fitting the model to the data using the collected data and features and tested to predict the player preferences and understand the working of Machine learning models and their accuracy/ F-1 Score.

 3.  Data Visualization: Visualize the players performance, the relationship between player attributes such as speed, agility, and shooting accuracy with their overall performance rating in the game. Compare the performance of different players over time or across different leagues and tournaments. Using machine learning algorithms to predict future performance and visualize the predictions along with the actual results.

 4. Making Predictions:
Pick out the best players based on the overall rating.
Which type of offensive players tend to get paid the most.
Top 5 players for different positions in terms of overall as well as potential points.
